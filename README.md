Hey,
this is a game made using turtle graphics and python, which I made during my junior year of high school. I have been using Python for quite some time now, but this is one of my first games made using python.
This game has been inspired by many other games, and you might find the names of some of the 'cards' familiar!
I have enclosed two versions(with 'game-changing' differences), do check out their rules in the beginning of the game(the rules are in the game itself) to see the difference.

Enjoy!
